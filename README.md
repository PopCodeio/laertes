Laertes
=======

This provides channels in the augmented reality smartphone application [Layar](http://www.layar.com/) for people together at the same event or conference.  It pulls together points of interest from group-annotated Google Maps and from geolocated and hashtagged tweets on Twitter and displays them in Layar's Geo Vision view.

In other words, if you're at a conference, you can hold up your smartphone and pan around and see where all of the interesting places are and where everyone's been tweeting from in the last little while.
